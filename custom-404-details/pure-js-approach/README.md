# Pure JS approach

Add the js in this folder to your wrapper in footer for best results to allow the dom to load the selector.

## What it does

* Check url string for '/idx/' so it doesn't run on non IDX pages.
* Rewrite the H1 tag

The rewrite can be changed to any message or any tag, even body to rewrite it all.
