# Custom 404 details pages

These scripts allow you to add custom 404 message for Details Pages.

# Requirements

jQuery on IDX Broker pages, which is included by default with "idx" variable. Code can be easily changed not to use jQuery if needed.

# Compatability

Tested with all recent details templates as of 9/1/2017

# Subehader

Subheader is easier to apply, but it has a noticeable delay before clients see the custom message

subehader.html code should be added under Designs -> Subheaders -> Pages -> Details (Turn WYSIWYG editor off)
It can be added as a Global Subheader as well

# Wrapper Footer 

wrapper-footer.html code should be added under Designs -> Wrappers
